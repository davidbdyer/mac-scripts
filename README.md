# mac-scripts

Useful scripts for Mac OS. Mac OS comes with an app called Script Editor. Script Editor is required to run or edit the scripts with the ".scpt" extension. It has an option to enable a menu bar item for quick access to the scripts. Script Editor will also export the scripts as text or as a stand-alone executable. Some of the ".sh" scripts require Raycast. Some of the bash aliases require additional software.

The **new-hcj**, **new-hsj** and **new-prettierrc** should be placed in a folder included in your PATH and given execution permissions.
