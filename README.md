# mac-scripts

## Scripts I've made for Mac OS over the years found useful.

The scripts in this repository are created to work on Mac OS.

### Applescripts
Mac OS comes with an app called Script Editor. Script Editor is required to run or edit scripts with the ".scpt" extension and is required to run .applescript unless the script is made for Raycast. Script Editor has an option to enable a menu bar item for quick access to the scripts. The option is under preferences and the general tab. Script Editor will also export the scripts as text or as a stand-alone executable.

### Bash and Bash aliases
Some of the bash aliases require additional software like youtube-dl. I use the bash scripts by making them executable and putting them in a folder within my path.

### Raycast
Some of the scripts are set up to work with Raycast. Raycast works with many languages, including AppleScript and Bash..
