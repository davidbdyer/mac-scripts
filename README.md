# mac-scripts

Useful scripts for Mac OS. Mac OS comes with an app called Script Editor. Script Editor is required to run or edit the scripts with the ".scpt" extension. Script Editor will also export the scripts as text, or as a stand-alone executable. Some of the ".sh" scripts require Raycast. Some of the aliases require installation software.
